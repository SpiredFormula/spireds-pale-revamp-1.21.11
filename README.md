Spired's Pale Revamp is a mod that redesigns the pale garden biome to act more like the deep dark
by making it a more dangerous place during night but also very rewarding.

The Creaking is a lot more dangerous and deals significantly more damage 

Mobs no longer spawn in the pale garden biome

### Further Notes

This is my first mod ever so sorry if it is a bit rough around the edges, any feedback about the mod is always welcome.
I enjoyed making it a lot and will continue to develop it by adding more features and porting it to other versions.
